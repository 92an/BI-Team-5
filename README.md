### Design Choices ###

#### Fonts ####

We have chosen [Josefin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans?query=jose#standard-styles) for all of the headers and [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?query=ralew#standard-styles) the rest of the text.

#### Colours ####

We have chosen the colour that say *"coffee now please!"*, applealing to the eye and also compliments the design of the project.
![Color palette](wireframes/Palette-6.png)

- *Grullo* (AF9483) - Light soft brown
- *Umber* (615550) - Dark bronw
- *Albaster* (F0EDE5) - Off white

These coulours will compliment each other well when used accross the site creating pleasant ambience.

#### Wireframes ####

We designed our site moc-ups using [balsamiq wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/). We were focusing on defining basic layout structure of the site and identifying how displays would change on different screen sizes such as [mobile](/wireframes/mobile.jpg), [tablet](/wireframes/tablet.jpg) and [desktop](/wireframes/desktop.jpg).
